Example : Men point to the women they want to marry and I should say the best matching.
	
	Men are 1 , 2
	Women are 3 ,4
	
	1->3 , 1->4 
	2->4
	
	if 1 married 4  two will not marry

This problem can be solved with max flow problem with all the Men as SOURCES and the Women as DESTINATIONS and the edges having weights = "1".

IF each man can marry more than one then the edge from the global source to that man is = "number of times he can marry".
